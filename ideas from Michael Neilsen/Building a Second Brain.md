## How many times have you tried to remember something important and felt it slip through your grasp?

How often have you struggled to recall even one useful takeaway from a book or article you read?

How much time have you wasted looking for a document or file you were sure you saved?

If your first thought was, “This happened to me today!” then you’re not alone.

**The sheer amount of information flooding our brains every day is overwhelming.**

Information Overload has long since become Information Exhaustion, taxing our mental resources and leaving us constantly anxious that we’re forgetting something.

Yet, information is **the fundamental building block of everything we do.**

Anything you want to accomplish, from executing a project at work to getting a new job, learning a new skill, and starting a business, requires finding and putting the right information to use.

Now, it’s time to acknowledge that **we can’t “use our head” to store everything we need to know**, and outsource the job of remembering to technology.

This is where a Second Brain comes in.

To make effective use of information, we need to package it up and make it accessible for our future self.

Building a Second Brain is a way to **cultivate a growing body of knowledge that is uniquely your own…**

So when the opportunity arises — whether that’s giving a big presentation, launching a new product, or starting a business or a family…

**You’ll have access to the wisdom you need to make sound decisions and take the most effective action.**
